# **Possessor Ban Log**  

This repository tracks all users I've banned for **exploiting, teaming, or other rule violations** in the Roblox game **Possessor**: [Possessor Game Link](https://www.roblox.com/games/14841485778/CODES-Possessor).  

ðŸš¨ **Important:** This list is for tracking my moderation progress. **Do not spread hate** to any users listed here.  

If you'd like to **report exploiters or teamers**, please use the **#exploiter-report** channel in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/possessor).  

Anyone can end up here if they break the rulesâ€”so play fair!

2. **Upload the video** to a platform like [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com).

## **What is considered "teaming"?**  
1. The obvious exampleâ€”being on call and saying *"I died" / "I'm possessed, get me."*  
2. If one of you is the **Exorcist** and the other is the **Possessor**, purposely choosing someone else or skipping the vote is considered teaming.  
3. If a **dead/AFK/lobby player** tells the **alive Exorcist** who is possessed, that is also teaming.  

ðŸ’¡ **Basically, anything that gives you and your friend an unfair advantage is considered teaming.**

## **I've been falsely banned/reportedâ€”what can I do?**

*"Hey, I believe I've been falsely reported. Can we do something about this?"*

### **Why these rules?**  
- This system keeps bans fair and consistent.  
- Video proof ensures **accurate** reports and **prevents false bans**.
