# Possessor Ban Log  

This is a list of all users I've banned for exploiting, teaming, or other rule violations in the Roblox game **Possessor**: [Possessor Game Link](https://www.roblox.com/games/14841485778/CODES-Possessor).  

ðŸš¨ **Important:** This list is for tracking my moderation progress. **Do not spread hate** to any users listed here.  

If you'd like to report exploiters or teamers, please use the **#exploiter-report** channel in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/possessor).  

Anyone can end up here if they break the rules, so play fair!  


# INFRACTION SYSTEM:

## Teaming:

 1st. A kick + warning "If caught agian, you will bans that increase in length (e.g. 1day, 2days, 3days, 1week). 

 2nd. After all the warnings have gone through, your 5th time will be a perm ban.

## Exploiting:

1st. Perm ban.

# How do I report someone?

1. Record video evidence of the exploiter/teamer (images work too, however they are alot less reliable meaning it may not be solid proof).
2. Upload that video to a video hosting platform (e.g. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com))

# Ive been falsey banned/reported, what can I do?

 1. DM me on discord @yo_bi and send me a dm saying "Hey, I believe ive been falsey reported. Can we do something about this please?"
